# Simple Interest Calculator 

## Objective
I have to create a spring-boot server with tomcat embedded in it. This server tracks loan accounts and calculates interest.

## Notes and assumptions from reading material online
- Charge interest only for the period the funds are actually outstanding. *Interest must start from actual disbursal date and be day accurate*.
- Apply interest at monthly rests (i.e. monthly compounding.) (Maybe have a provision to add daily interest for special cases)
- Penal charges are not interest, must not be capitalized, and must be levied only on the amount under default.

So, 
- The daily interest calculator will accumulate the interest everyday at 24 hour intervals. But not add it to the principal (yet).
- At month end, add accumulated interest to principal. Next months daily calculations use NEW principal (which includes last month's interest).
- Any penalties ex. late fees should be calculated and handled separately (not added to the principal). It is included to the total due.

## Reccurring jobs

### Daily Job
- Calculates the interest based on the principal amount every day at 11:59:00 PM IST (Bec India).
### Monthly Job
- Adds the interest to the principal and clears the accumulated interest.

## Technical notes and thoughts:
- For the daily and monthly jobs, batch processing and locking would be useful for scaling up.
- To make this code modular, I am writing a dockerfile and a docker-compose YAML.

# Additional Problem

## Square substring problem
My understanding of the problem statement: Given a string, find the length of the shortest non-empty string w such that ww is a substring of the given string.

The output expected is \[length of the shortest square substring(s)\]\[earliest starting index of substring with that length\]

After struggling to wrap my head around the proposed solution within the problem for an hour, I asked an LLM to explain it to me.
What I took away from it:

- The solution substring will always have a length of 2w. here w is the length of the square string's repeating element.
- Start with the smallest possibility and keep iterating till the biggest one. w = 1,2,3 ... l = 1,2,4,6...
- Break the string into blocks of size l
-  l in range 1, to len(s)/2 in multiples of 2.
- This ensures that the smallest square string is found at the first occuring index.
- For every index i, check for same block upto 3l-2 indices far on the right.
- If a repeating character is found, check for the complete block of length w.
- For each (i,j) match, expand symmetically (left and right)
- If found, expand the square string w to left and right. If the length w = i - j Where the two blocks start then we have the smallest square.
That's the answer.

```python
def solution(s: str) -> list[int]:
    n = len(s)
    l = 1
    ans = []
    while l <= n//2:
        i = 0
        j = l
        while j <= n-l:
            if s[i:i+l] == s[j:j+l]:
                # blocks meet the condition
                # There is a flaw in this - which assumes that blocks are of length l 
                break
            j += 1
        # Increment
        l *= 2

## Stage 3

### Account Aggregators.
**What is an account aggegator?**
It is a regulatead digital entity (org) that helps FIUs (Financial Information Users) gather different vectors of financial data of their customers.

I am integrating digio as the TSP (Technology Service Provider) for the purpose of account aggregator in my backend to manage consent and data collection of customers or loan applicants.

**Sandbox Testing**: Testing integrations. I am not attempting to actually ship this code to production. My focus is on creating and testing those integrations in the sandbox that digio provides.


Exerpt from the docs at digio. 
```
2. FIU Module Development
The next step is to develop an FIU module, either in-house or with the support of a Technology Service Provider (TSP). This module:

Sends consent requests to AAs on behalf of the user
Fetches encrypted financial information once the user consents
Handles consent lifecycle (creation, revocation, expiry)
Ensures data is decrypted and processed securely
The module must adhere to the technical specifications defined by ReBIT, which include data formats (JSON/XML), encryption standards, error handling, and more.

3. Integration with Account Aggregators (AAs)
Once the FIU module is developed, the next step is to integrate with one or more licensed Account Aggregators. This includes:

Setting up secure API integrations to exchange consent artefacts and financial data
Establishing mutual authentication (digital certificates)
Configuring the routing of requests and responses
Ensuring endpoint whitelisting and IP filtering, if applicable
AAs act as consent managers and data pipelines, hence a successful integration ensures compliance with the userâ€™s consent and secure data transmission.

4. Sandbox Testing
After integration, FIUs must test their module in a sandbox environment provided by AAs. The sandbox is a controlled space where:

End-to-end consent flows are simulated
Error cases (invalid consent, expired tokens, etc.) are tested
Security, latency, and response formats are validated
Compliance with functional and technical standards is verified
This phase is mandatory and helps ensure smooth operations before moving to the live (production) environment.
