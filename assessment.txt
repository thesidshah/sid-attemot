Take home Assignment: 
 
1) Install PostgreSQL (or other database system if itâ€™s already setup) in your desktop 
and host a table with entries for id, name, interest rate, interest amount, 
principal amount and date of disbursal.  
2) Code a backend API using SpringBoot to apply interest on the principal amount 
and update the interest amount at the end of every day at an exact time*. Make 
sure your emphasis is on concurrency handling and efficiency. 
3) Host the backend on localhost (127.0.0.1:8080) of your PC using apache tomcat 
and demonstrate the functionality (put the exact time to be the demonstration 
time).
